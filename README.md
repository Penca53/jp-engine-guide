# SFML Engine Guide

This repository provides code checkpoints corresponding to each chapter of the SFML Engine guide. These checkpoints are intended to help verify the final state of the project after completing each chapter. Each chapter's code is organized into a separate subfolder, simplifying the process of compiling and running the code at that specific stage.
